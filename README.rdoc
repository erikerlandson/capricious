Capricious is a library for pseudo-random number generation; it
is primarily intended for use in simulation. Currently, several
distributions (uniform, biased-uniform, Erlang, exponential, 
normal, and Poisson) are provided over two underlying pseudo-
random generators (a linear-feedback shift register and a 
multiply-with-carry generator), but in the future Capricious 
will provide more of each.
